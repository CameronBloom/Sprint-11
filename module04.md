### Objective 1 - Explain How the World Wide Web Works
- The web is just one way to share data over the internet. 
- The web consists of a body of information stored on web servers, ready to be shared worldwide.
- The term "web server" can mean:
- - 1. A computer that stores the code for a website.
- - 2. A program that runs on such a computer.
- Computers can:
- - 1. Connect to the internet via the world wide web.
- - 2. Locate a specific server computer through a URL and domain name.
- - 3. Retrieve information or resources from that server.

### Objective 2 - Explain What it Means to Deploy a Static Website
- Most data on the web is shared through websites and web applications.
- Web apps are made up of code, primarily JavaScript.
- We need to host that project on a web server to serve up to people connected to the web.
- A static site has hardcoded data that doesn't change.
